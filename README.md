# C Example | Language programming project
#### Author: Bocaletto Luca

This repository contains a collection of various C programming projects designed to illustrate fundamental and advanced concepts in C. Each project is developed as a one-page example with detailed inline comments to help developers understand the language. All projects are fully documented and serve as practical exercises for learning and improving your C programming skills.

1. **Hello World Program**  
   A basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, introducing the core structure of a C program.

2. **Simple Calculator**  
   A command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

3. **Temperature Converter**  
   Converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit using user-defined criteria.

4. **Random Number Guessing Game**  
   A game where the computer selects a random number and the user guesses it, with hints provided for each guess.

5. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**  
   Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using iterative methods.

6. **Prime Number Checker**  
   Checks if an input number is prime, utilizing optimized loop conditions to improve efficiency.

7. **File I/O: Read and Write**  
   Demonstrates basic file input and output operations by writing user input to a file and reading it back.

8. **Array-Based Stack Implementation**  
   Implements a stack data structure using a fixed-size array, supporting push, pop, and peek operations.

9. **Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort**  
   Provides complete examples of bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms applied to an array of integers.

10. **Searching Algorithms: Linear and Binary Search**  
    Compares linear search with binary search, including requirements for sorting and efficiency considerations.

11. **Singly Linked List Implementation**  
    Demonstrates a singly linked list with operations to insert, search, delete, and display nodes.

12. **Basic Banking System Simulation**  
    A simulation of a simple banking system that includes account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking, with persistent file storage.

13. **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
    A text-based Tic Tac Toe game for two players, complete with win/tie conditions and board display logic.

14. **Hangman Game**  
    Implements the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters of a secret word with a limited number of wrong attempts.

15. **Caesar Cipher for Encryption/Decryption**  
    Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher, shifting letters by a specified number and handling both cases of text.

16. **Student Record Management System**  
    A simple CRUD system to manage student records stored in a binary file, featuring operations to create, list, search, update, and delete records.

17. **Memory Management and Pointer Exercises**  
    A series of exercises focusing on dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and proper memory deallocation.

18. **Multithreading with POSIX Threads (pthreads)**  
    Demonstrates the creation and synchronization of multiple threads using pthreads, with mutex locks to protect shared data.

19. **Basic Chatbot Program**  
    A simple text-based chatbot that utilizes basic string pattern matching to respond to user input in an interactive loop.

20. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation**  
    Implements a binary search tree with operations for insertion, searching, and traversals (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
